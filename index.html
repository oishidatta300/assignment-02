                <h3>How to introduce yourself—and get hired | Rebecca Okamoto |</h3>
                <p>First impressions matter! A great introduction can be a powerful door opener to new possibilities.
                    However, with today’s split-second attention spans, you may only have seconds to turn your
                    introduction into a career or business building opportunity. If you dread answering “Tell me about
                    yourself” or struggle to explain what makes you unique, join Rebecca Okamoto. You’ll learn
                    step-by-step how to introduce yourself perfectly in 20 words or less and leave a lasting, positive
                    impression.
